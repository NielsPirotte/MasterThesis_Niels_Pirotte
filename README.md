# MasterThesis_Niels_Pirotte
VHDL design of ASIC implementation for ECC with complete formulae

## General
The design uses an active low reset

### MM_design1
First implementation of Montgomery Multiplication with 2 4N inputs and a 2N output.
Also 2 2N inputs can be added and subtracted resulting in a 4N output

### MM_design2
Implementation according to the paper of KoÃ§: "A scalable Architecture for Montgomery Multiplier"

### PA_design1
Implementation of Point Addition with complete formulae according to: "Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves" p13 algorithm 8

### PM_design1
Implementation of point multiplication using the principle of the Montgomery Ladder

## TODO

### In progress

#### 1 -- done and tested

Implement Point Addition

Remark: The implementation is working properly, but keep in mind that x2 and y2 need to be converted to the montgomery domain. They are the only inputs that need to be converted.

Also the done signal of point_addition.vhd needs to be corrected.

#### 2 -- done, not possible (recheck after first implementation)

Look at shiftmechanism for multiplexers

#### 3 -- Implemented, but not tested

Implement scalable architecture --> Koc

#### 4

Optimalization

### Completed

Implement non-modular subtraction and addition

Implement point multiplication module

Counter adders can be more efficient (counter.vhd)
