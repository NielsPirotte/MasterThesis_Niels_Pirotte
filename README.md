# MasterThesis_Niels_Pirotte
VHDL design of ASIC implementation for ECC with complete formulae

## MM_design1
First implementation of Montgomery Multiplication with 4N outputs and 2N outputs.
Also 2 2N inputs can be added and subtracted resulting in a 4N output

## MM_design2
Implementation according to the paper of Ko√ß: "A scalable Architecture for Montgomery Multiplier"

## PA_design1
Implementation of Point Addition with complete formulae according to: "Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves" p13 algorithm 8

## PM_design1
Implementation of point multiplication using the principle of the Montgomery Ladder
